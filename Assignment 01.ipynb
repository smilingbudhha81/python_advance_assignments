    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple instances of an object can be made.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS = \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute fetches are simply tree searches. \n",
    "The term inheritance is applied because objects lower in a tree inherit attributes attached to objects higher in that tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the search proceeds from the bottom up, in a sense, the objects linked into a tree are the union of all the attributes defined in all their tree parents, all the way up the tree.\n",

    "# Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS = \n",
    "The differences between a class object and an instance object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "but for a class this doesnot happens.\n",
    "A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Classes have no allocated memory. they can't be manipulated. but objects can be manipulated.\n",

    "\n",
    "Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It binds the attributes with the given arguments.The reason you need to use self.\n",
    "\n",
    "IT is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on.\n",

    "ANS = \n",
    "\n",
    "__init__ is a reseved method in python classes. It serves the role of a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class\n",
